# CLI Commands REST API

##### Lets be honest, there are way to many CLI commands to learn. It would be useful to have an API that returns to us commands that we often may forget. The Commands API stores for us command line snippetes along with a "how to" description of what the command does and what platform it is for.

### The purpose behind this project is to learn and practice the core concepts behind:
> - Building a REST API
> - ASP.NET Core
> - Model View Controller (MVC) Architectural Pattern
> - C#
### During the project, I used...
> - Dependency injection
> - Repository design patterns
> - PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4
> - EntityFrameworkCore (DB Context & Migrations)
> - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Automapper
> - CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) -> HTTP Requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and status codes
> - Testing API Endpoitns (SwaggerUI)
> - Docker (Containers and Images)
